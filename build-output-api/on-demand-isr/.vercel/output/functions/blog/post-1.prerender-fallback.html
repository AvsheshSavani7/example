  <h1>Post: post-1</h1>
  
  <p>This demonstrates a SSG blog that restricts generating new paths via On-Demand ISR instead of allowing any visited paths to generate a new path.</p>
  
  <p>It works by leveraging `expiration: false` on a prerender to only allow generating new paths when the revalidate token is provided.</p>
